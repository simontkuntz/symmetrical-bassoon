/*
 * File: IntField.java
 *
 * Description:  This version of IntField has both an upper and lower bound
 *  associated with it. The user must type a number within these bounds
 *  into the field. A programmer defined exception, IntOutOfRangeException, is
 *  thrown if the bound is exceeded.
 * Note that upperBound and lowerBound are set initially to MAX and MIN possible
 *  values respectively. This allows the field to accept any numeric input if
 *  its first constructor is used.
 *
 *  Assignment: See ColorPicker.java
